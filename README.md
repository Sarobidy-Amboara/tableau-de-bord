# Reporting DRC - UI (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a scaffolded frontend to migrate the existing vanilla JS app into a React + Tailwind project.

How to run

1. Install dependencies:

   npm install

2. Start dev server:

   npm run dev

Notes

- This scaffold includes Chart.js and xlsx as dependencies to reuse the existing charting and Excel parsing logic.
- After you run `npm install`, I can continue migrating the logic from `app.js` into React components (file import, parsing, state management, charts).
